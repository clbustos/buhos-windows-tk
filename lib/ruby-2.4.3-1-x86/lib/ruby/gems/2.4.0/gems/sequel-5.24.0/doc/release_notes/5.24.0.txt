= New Features

* A :cache_file plugin option has been added to the
  pg_auto_constraint_validations plugin.  This option specifies
  a file to use to cache the metadata the plugin uses, so the
  plugin does not need to run 5 queries per model at startup to
  load the metadata.  This can dramatically improve startup time
  when using the plugin with a large number of models.

  To create the metadata file, load the plugin into Sequel::Model
  (or whatever class you are using as the base class for your
  model classes) with the :cache_file option, and after loading
  all of the subclasses of that class, run:

    Sequel::Model.dump_pg_auto_constraint_validations_cache

  As when using the schema_caching and index_caching extensions,
  it is up to the user to ensure that the cached metadata matches
  the current database schema.  Sequel does no checking of this,
  as checking would take more time, and the point of this plugin
  is to improve startup performance.

* A static_cache_cache plugin has been added.  This plugin allows
  for caching rows for models using the static_cache plugin. This
  prevents the need to issue a query at model creation time to
  get the rows.  This plugin should be loaded into Sequel::Model
  (or whatever class you are using as the base class for your
  model classes) before loading the models using the static_cache
  plugin.  To create the metadata file, after all subclasses of
  that class have been loaded, run:

    Sequel::Model.dump_static_cache_cache

* :unique_deferrable and :primary_key_deferrable column
  options are now supported on PostgreSQL 9+ and Oracle. This
  allows you to created deferrable unique and primary key
  column constraints.  You could already create deferrable
  table constraints using the :deferrable option to the primary_key
  and unique methods.

* A :generated_always_as column option is now supported on
  PostgreSQL 12+, for creating generated columns.

* A Database#skip_logging? private method has been added.  This
  is designed for use in extensions, to force log timing even
  when no loggers are configured.

= Other Improvements

* Sequel no longer sets the :host option to localhost by default
  in the mysql2 adapter.  This prevents Sequel from overriding
  a host specified in the defaults_file.

* All database array types are converted to Ruby arrays in the
  jdbc adapter.  Previously, this was only done in the
  jdbc/postgresql subadapter.
