= New Features

* An instance-level skip_auto_validations method has been added to
  the auto_validations plugin, allowing you to skip all or specific
  types of auto validations inside the block:

    model_instance.skip_auto_validations(:unique) do
      puts model_instance.valid?
    end

* A Database :preconnect_extensions option has been added.  This
  option is similar to :extensions, but the extensions are loaded
  before the :preconnect option is processed.  This allows you to
  use the server_logging extension with the :preconnect option.

* For specifying custom table aliases when using eager_graph and
  association_join, you can now use:

    Sequel[:association].as(:table_alias)

  in addition to:

    Sequel.as(:association, :table_alias)

= Other Improvements

* The ado/mssql adapter now retrieves the number of deleted or
  updated rows for a query without issuing a separate query.

* Sequel now avoids the use of Proc.new with an implicit block, as
  that feature will be deprecated starting in Ruby 2.7.
